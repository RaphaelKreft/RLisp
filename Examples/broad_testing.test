; This file contains a bunch of tests that should show that all basic language expressions work as expected
; I therefore also included some programs from the homework that was given in the lecture that this interpreter is
; part of as a project

; 1. Integer arithmetics

(println 'Simple addition (+ 1 1 1 1)')
(println (+ 1 1 1 1))

(println 'Simple subtraction (- 1 1 2)')
(println (- 1 1 2))

(println 'Simple division (/ 10 2)')
(println (/ 10 2))

(println 'Simple multiplication (* 1 2 3 4)')
(println (+ 1 2 3 4))

(println 'More complex (* 2 (+ 5 (- 22 19)))')
(println (* 2 (+ 5 (- 22 19))))

; 2. List operations

; 3. Conditions, type-checks and equality

(println 'Simple Conditional (cond ((eq? 12 6) 1) (#t 2))')
(println (cond ((eq? 12 6) 1) (#t 2)))

(println 'Typecheck list (list? (1,2,3))')
(println (list? (1,2,3)))

(println 'Typecheck number (number? 12)')
(println (number? 12))

(println '')
